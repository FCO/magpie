This directory contains the sources for the various applications 
used in the test suite, as well as the 'skel' directory which
offers a clean layout for creating new apps.

To create a new app: 
* copy (cp -R) the skel dir somewhere safe
* add your Perl classes into the lib/ directory
* add your static content to the static/ directory
* edit conf/application.yaml give your app a unique URL token and set up the pipeline for your app.
* cd into your copy of the skel directory and use zip to create the PAR archive
* move the archive into a SAWAServer-aware directory and restart the server.

note: if you are editing the test suite files, be sure to exclude the CVS/.svn dirs 
when creating the zip. eg: zip -r MyApp.par . -x */CVS/*
